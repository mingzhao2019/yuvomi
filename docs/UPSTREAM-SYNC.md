# Upstream synchronization

`custom` is a maintained product branch, not a thin fork. It shares the upstream
Yuvomi base, but several data models, routes, synchronization rules, and UI
surfaces are intentionally different. The detailed preservation checklist lives
in [`CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`](CUSTOMIZATIONS.md); use that file when a change touches
one of the areas below.

## Branch roles

- `main` is the upstream-compatible baseline and follows `upstream/main`.
- `custom` contains product-specific behavior and is used for development,
  deployment, and releases.
- `upstream` is the public Yuvomi remote used for review and fast-forwarding
  local `main`.
- `custom` must not be updated by replacing it wholesale with `upstream/main`.

## Custom boundaries

### Tasks and Microsoft To Do

- Task lists are persistent first-class objects. Preserve source/list identity,
  selected-list state, permissions, ordering, and deletion cleanup.
- Microsoft To Do synchronization keeps list mapping, incremental/full sync,
  recurrence, reminders, timezone conversion, and explicit user selection.
  Connecting an account must not silently enable or fully sync every list.
- Microsoft `steps`/`checklistItems` are not Yuvomi subtasks. Yuvomi subtasks
  have independent IDs, permissions, visibility, and parent relationships.
  Markdown checklists in task descriptions are a separate native feature.

### Calendars and subscriptions

- Preserve Outlook bidirectional sync, calendar selection, conflict handling,
  date windows, default reminders, and timezone semantics.
- Preserve Google, CalDAV, and ICS/WebCal behavior, including provider-specific
  reminders and the strict read-only boundary for ICS subscriptions.
- Do not treat provider accounts, calendar targets, VTODO lists, and event
  reminders as interchangeable settings or data.

### Notification channels

- Personal and household channels have separate configuration, permissions,
  templates, and recipient scopes. Do not merge their management paths.
- Preserve provider payload contracts, timezone-aware readable times, empty-field
  handling, trusted-link rules, and test-send behavior.

### Inventory and assets

- Assets use the existing Inventory API, database, permissions, visibility, and
  dashboard widgets. Do not introduce a second asset store or direct database
  access from the frontend.
- Preserve personal/household visibility, groups, cost calculations, dates,
  images, reminders, and the image-search workflow.

### API and UI contracts

- New or ported behavior must use the existing `/api/v1` contracts, permission
  checks, visibility rules, synchronization identity, and timezone handling.
- Preserve desktop and mobile layout slots, responsive interactions, list/detail
  behavior, search entry points, and the home dashboard widgets.
- Never resolve an overlap by selecting an entire file from `ours` or `theirs`.
  Combine behavior and remove only the specific incompatible fragment.

## Version and migration rules

- Read the release version from `main:package.json` after updating local `main`.
- Keep the root `package.json`, the two root version fields in
  `package-lock.json`, `public/sw.js`'s `APP_RELEASE`, and current release
  metadata synchronized.
- Do not modify historical `CHANGELOG.md` entries while updating current-release
  references.
- Database migrations are append-only. Never rewrite a released migration number,
  schema change, or historical behavior.
- A version mismatch is a release defect, not a browser-cache issue.

## Selective sync workflow

1. Confirm the worktree is clean, inspect branch topology, and verify the
   `origin` and `upstream` URLs. Never hide or discard unexplained work.

2. Refresh upstream and update only local `main` by fast-forward:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git switch main
   git merge --ff-only upstream/main
   git rev-parse main upstream/main
   ```

   The two hashes must match. If fast-forwarding is not possible, stop and
   resolve the divergence explicitly. Do not reset, rebase, or force-update
   `main`.

3. Create a dated integration branch from the current `custom` branch:

   ```bash
   git switch custom
   git switch -c custom-upstream-selective-YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

   If that branch already exists, inspect its ownership and state. Do not reuse
   an unknown branch.

4. Review every upstream commit in order. Classify each change as a correctness
   or security fix, independent feature, coupled feature, duplicate, or truly
   unnecessary change. Cherry-pick only genuinely independent commits. Port
   coupled changes manually and preserve the custom contracts above.

5. For each overlap, check migrations, API fields and errors, permissions,
   visibility, sync identity, conflicts, timezones, reminders, and desktop/mobile
   behavior. Record the decision and affected behavior in the integration commit
   or the current sync record; do not silently drop a fragment.

6. Validate on the integration branch before merging it into `custom`:

   ```bash
   git diff --check
   git diff --stat custom...HEAD
   git log --oneline --decorate custom..HEAD
   npm test
   ```

   Also run focused tests for affected modules, check version consistency, and
   explicitly confirm task lists, Microsoft To Do, Outlook/ICS calendars,
   notification channels, assets, and dashboard widgets remain intact.

7. After validation, fast-forward `custom` and remove the temporary branch:

   ```bash
   git switch custom
   git merge --ff-only custom-upstream-selective-YYYY-MM-DD
   git branch -d custom-upstream-selective-YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

   Pushes, force-pushes, remote branch deletion, deployment, and permission
   changes require explicit authorization. Never use a force push to repair a
   failed synchronization.

## Current sync checkpoint

As of 2026-09-28, the latest reviewed upstream checkpoint is `b23ce8fbd`
(#1489), following `9a9864a59`. It was selectively ported from `custom`
commit `bb3b3ef48` into the current `custom` history; the upstream branch was
not merged wholesale.

The review covered the dashboard, document and budget surfaces, mobile shell,
shared controls, sheets and list/detail navigation, task selection, health and
calendar layouts, and the final settings structure. The port preserved custom
task-list and provider behavior, notification scopes, inventory/assets,
permissions, dashboard widgets, and the Microsoft To Do checklist boundary.
It introduced no new database migration or API data model, and no released
migration was rewritten.

The current release version at this checkpoint is `2.69.1`. The completed
integration passed focused tests, the full `npm test` suite, `git diff --check`,
and version-consistency checks. Replace this section with a new checkpoint
summary during the next upstream sync rather than extending an ever-growing
historical table.
