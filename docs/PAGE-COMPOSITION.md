# Yuvomi Page Composition System

Spatial composition standard for Yuvomi application pages and third-party extension modules.

**Visual language** lives in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) and [`public/styles/tokens.css`](public/styles/tokens.css).  
**Spatial composition** lives here, in layout primitives, and in [`public/utils/page-layout.js`](public/utils/page-layout.js).

```text
DESIGN SYSTEM
├── Visual language          → DESIGN.md + tokens.css
└── Page Composition System  → PAGE-COMPOSITION.md + layout primitives + audit
```

Budget core is **not** the reference implementation. It migrates as an offender alongside other modules.

---

## Part A - Composition Principles

### Principle Zero

> **A page is composed from a small set of spatial primitives. Individual modules may provide content and module-specific components, but must not define their own page geometry.**

A module owns: data, components, content, local interactions.

A module does **not** own: page width, horizontal alignment, global spacing, position vs shell, breakpoints, page header geometry, page grid.

```text
OK:   Module → Page → PageHeader + PageBody → module content
BAD:  Module → custom .page { width; padding; margin; breakpoint; absolute }
```

### Five spatial levels

```text
Application
└── ApplicationShell        # nav, chrome, viewport, overlays - NEVER module-owned
    └── Page                # composition mode, width token, gutters, header/body rhythm
        ├── PageHeader      # title, context, actions, nav - shares composition context with body
        └── PageBody
            └── Section     # semantic group; no page geometry
                └── Group
                    └── Component  # internal layout only
```

### Composition modes (exactly one per page)

| Mode | Purpose | Width token |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `reading` | contacts, recipes, tasks list, forms | `--layout-reading` (~720px) |
| `data` | tables, inventory, large datasets | `--layout-content` (~960px) |
| `dashboard` | KPI grids, health, analytics | `--layout-wide` (~1200px) |
| `form` | complex forms inside reading column | `--layout-reading` |
| `split` | master/detail; stacks on mobile | split rails |
| `full` | calendar month, kanban, notes masonry, schedule, documents browser, immersive | usable width |

Arbitrary values such as `max-width: 843px` are prohibited.

### Primary alignment edge

PageHeader, PageBody, and primary sections share one vertical axis. Components must not introduce a page-level axis.

### Full-bleed

Only via the explicit pattern `.page-section--bleed`. Negative margins for layout compensation are prohibited.

### Spacing rhythm

Component / Group / Section / Page - semantic distance equals spatial distance. Use layout tokens, not ad-hoc pixel values.

### Responsive behaviour

Responsive transformation is a property of the composition mode, not a module-local `@media (max-width: 637px)`.

### Components vs pages

**Components control internal layout; pages control external layout.**

### Extension declaration

Third-party modules declare intent; they do not implement geometry:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "composition": "reading",
    "width": "reading",
    "navigation": "standard",
    "responsive": "standard"
  }
}
```

### Blacklist

```text
❌ custom .page / page-container geometry
❌ arbitrary max-width / page margin / page padding
❌ negative margins to compensate for layout
❌ viewport-based positioning / absolute page-level layout
❌ module-owned breakpoints for page geometry
❌ changes to ApplicationShell
❌ custom page header outside approved primitives
❌ compensating for a core layout bug with local CSS
```

> **A module MUST NOT compensate for a core layout problem with local CSS.**

### Out of scope (v1 exceptions)

Documented exceptions - not forced through composition modes in v1:

- Shopping kitchen tabs shell
- Meals slot grid
- Settings SPA shell
- Auth chrome (login, setup, join, password reset)

## Part B - Implementation Contract

### Layout width tokens

Defined in [`public/styles/tokens.css`](public/styles/tokens.css):

| Token | Default | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| `--layout-reading` | 720px | reading / form columns |
| `--layout-content` | 960px | data tables and wide lists |
| `--layout-wide` | 1200px | dashboard / KPI grids |

Legacy aliases remain for one release cycle:

- `--content-max-width-narrow` → `--layout-reading`
- `.page-measure--narrow` → reading mode compat class

### CSS primitives

Defined in [`public/styles/layout.css`](public/styles/layout.css):

| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| `.app-page` | page root; no module geometry |
| `.app-page--reading\|data\|dashboard\|form\|split\|full` | composition mode; sets `--page-measure` |
| `.app-page__body` | page body slot (mode-owned gutters) |
| `.page-measure` | caps width to `--page-measure` (left-aligned) |
| `.page-section` | semantic section; no page geometry |
| `.page-section--bleed` | explicit full-bleed band |
| `.page-toolbar--narrow` | header row ends at `--page-measure` via `::after`; the slots stay direct children (no rail element) |

Mode modifiers set `--page-measure`:

- `reading`, `form` → `--layout-reading`
- `data` → `--layout-content`
- `dashboard` → `--layout-wide`
- `split`, `full` → `100%` (no measure; a length rather than `none`, because the
  header formulas in `.page-toolbar--narrow` subtract it in `calc()` - with `100%`
  they resolve to zero, so a narrow header is a no-op on these pages instead of an
  invalid declaration)

`split` puts the two-column grid on `.app-page__body` once the *page* is at
least 768px wide (a container query on the split root, not a viewport query:
beside the expanded sidebar a 1024px viewport leaves the page about 804px). The
body's first child is the master rail (up to `--layout-reading`, but never more
than half of the body), the second the detail rail; the header stays a full row
above. Below 768px of page width the body stacks. The split body carries the page gutter (`padding-inline: var(--page-inline-pad)`) like the
measured modes do, so the rails start on the same edge as the title; `full` is
the one mode whose body has no gutter, because there the page owns its edges.
`full` and `split` roots built with `renderAppPage()` take the shell height
(`height: 100%`), so a `flex: 1` body can host an internal scrollport without
module CSS sizing the page.

### JavaScript helpers

[`public/utils/page-layout.js`](public/utils/page-layout.js):

| Export | Role |
|--------|------|
| `renderAppPage` | page root with mode + `data-composition` |
| `renderPageHeader` | canonical `.page-toolbar`; title, center and actions are its direct children in every option combination |
| `renderPageTitle` | `.page-toolbar__title` |
| `renderPageActions` | `.page-toolbar__actions` |
| `renderPageBody` | `.app-page__body` |
| `renderPageSection` | `.page-section` (+ measure by default) |
| `renderListSection` | list section with measure cap |
| `renderMetricBand` | KPI band on the page measure |

Modules must not set page width, gutters, or breakpoints. They pass content into these helpers.

### Deprecations (1-2 releases)

| Legacy | Replacement |
|--------|-------------|
| `.page-measure--narrow` | `.app-page--reading` |
| `.budget-list-section` | `.page-section` |

New code must not introduce legacy aliases. Reference page already omits `.page-measure--narrow`.

### Audit invariants

Enforced in [`test/test-frontend-audit.js`](test/test-frontend-audit.js):

| ID | Invariant |
|----|-----------|
| PAGE-001 | Page has exactly one composition mode |
| PAGE-002 | PageHeader and PageBody share composition context |
| PAGE-003 | Primary content does not define arbitrary width |
| PAGE-004 | Page-level spacing uses layout tokens |
| PAGE-005 | Page does not define local breakpoints (allowlisted exceptions) |
| PAGE-006 | Page-level negative margins are prohibited |
| PAGE-007 | Helpers export the approved layout surface |
| PAGE-008 | Primary content edges align with declared grid |
| PAGE-009 | Responsive transformation follows composition mode |
| PAGE-010 | Full-bleed regions are explicitly declared (`--bleed`) |

**Scope: every page behind the app shell.** The audit derives that set from
`public/router.js` rather than from a list somebody has to remember: a route with
`requiresAuth: false` renders without navigation and is outside the contract, and
everything else is inside it. A page added tomorrow is covered on the day it gets
a route, without anyone adding it anywhere.

### The exception list only shrinks

Three pages predate the contract and do not satisfy it yet:

```js
const COMPOSITION_PENDING = new Set(['shopping.js', 'meals.js', 'settings.js']);
```

That list lives in `test/test-frontend-audit.js`, and a second test fails if it
grows. Migrating a page is therefore a deletion: remove the line, and the page is
held to the same rules as the rest. Progress is visible in the guard rather than
in a table that has to be kept honest by hand.

This is deliberate. An allowlist covers the files somebody remembered to add;
a rule covers the problem. The codebase has paid for that lesson twice already,
in the kitchen consolidation and in the budget guards.

### Worked example

[`public/pages/birthdays.js`](../public/pages/birthdays.js) is the cleanest page
to read if you want to see the composition in one piece. It carries no special
marker: it is audited by exactly the same rules as every other page, and nothing
in the production markup says otherwise.

Open **`/birthdays`** on a wide desktop (1440 / 1920) to see the structure:

```text
.app-page--reading
|- .page-toolbar.page-toolbar--narrow
|  |- .page-toolbar__title                <- direct children, no rail element:
|  |- .page-search                           the collapsing header and the
|  |- .page-toolbar__actions                 large title select `> .page-toolbar__title`
|  `- ::after                             <- holds the row end at --page-measure
`- .app-page__body
   |- .page-section.page-measure          <- hint
   `- .page-section--list.page-measure    <- .row-carrier list
```

There is no `.page-toolbar__rail` in this tree, and no option combination
produces one: the helper emits the slots directly under the toolbar in every
case, and with `narrow` the `::after` spacer holds the edge. An earlier draft
kept a rail box for `measured` without `narrow`; it made the title a grandchild
and hid it from the selectors that build the head seal and the dock title, so
the option and the element are gone (PAGE-007b, and a guard that fails on the
class names anywhere under `public/`). Do not recreate the wrapper by hand; if a
page ever needs one, `ux.js` and `typography.css` have to learn to find the
title through it first.

### Visual regression (phase 2+)

Viewports **390 / 768 / 1024 / 1440 / 1920**: screenshot plus width, alignment and
overflow checks. Not wired into CI yet.

## FAQ - closed requirements

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is Budget the layout reference? | **No.** There is no reference page. Budget is an offender; the rules are the contract. |
| Must every page use `page-layout.js`? | Every page behind the app shell must declare a mode. Deep helper migration follows page by page; the three pending pages are named in the guard. |
| Why still `page-toolbar--narrow`? | Large-Title / wrap CSS and the head seal (`:scope > .page-toolbar__title`) key off direct toolbar children. `narrow` holds the row end with a pseudo-element, so no wrapper is needed and those selectors keep working. A `measured` rail box was tried and removed: it put the title one level down. |
| Why `--layout-*` and `--content-max-width-narrow`? | `--layout-*` is the contract; narrow is a one-cycle alias. |
| Can extensions invent width? | **No.** Declare `page.composition` and use helpers / `.app-page--*`. |
| What about shopping / meals / settings / auth? | Documented v1 exceptions - do not force composition modes yet. |
| How do I review this PR visually? | Open `/birthdays` at 1920px: one reading column, header actions flush with list edge. |

## Migration checklist

| Wave | Mode | Modules | Status in this PR |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| Reference | `reading` | **birthdays** | **Done (helpers + CSS)** |
| A | `reading` | contacts, rewards, pantry, recipes | Mode declared |
| B | `data` | inventory, housekeeping | Mode declared |
| B' | `full` | schedule, documents | Mode declared. Both were `data` until the seventh review round: their headers run full width (no `--narrow`), so the 960px measure was visible only on the primitives that happen to consume it - the KPI band of the schedule statistics ended at 960 while the filter card and the result cards beside it did not. `full` sets the measure to 100% and caps nothing, which is what these pages looked like before this PR. PAGE-016 keeps it that way: a measured mode needs a narrow header, or nothing on the page may consume the measure |
| C | budget family | budget + stats/plans | Mode declared (`reading`); stats and plans are tab panels inside the Budget page and inherit its measure. A per-tab mode (reports as `dashboard`) also means switching the shared header per tab - an open design decision, not done here |
| C' | `full` / `split` | subscriptions (`full`), split-expenses (`split`) | Mode declared; content not on a measure yet (analytics grid / two-column layout own their width) |
| D | `dashboard` / `full` | calendar, tasks, notes, health, dashboard | Mode declared |

After v1, every layout question becomes: *which composition mode, and which contract clause is violated?*
